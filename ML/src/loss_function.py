"""Module on which we will provide definition of loss function."""

"""Loss function is any rule which connect elemts from the set of ordered parirs of real target value 
and target value defined by the model function rule to element of real number set, and that number 
we indicate us how differen element from ordered pais are.

So by defining that rule we will be able to measue any ordered pair or target and function target elements
how different they are.

Quality functionality is averaged loss function fo all the samples of the set, and generaly it shows
how different target element from predicted target element in average.
