"""Model quality evaluation.
Let's suppose that we have some business idea which will make money for us.
To realise that  idea we decide to use some machine learning tools. After some  development
process we came up  with  2 tools  which solves very the same  question, so now  we  have
to  decide  which  one  to choose, and it  is  examly  that moment  when we come up with
questoin of model  quality evaluation. 
Model quality  evaluation is  a process of  choosing between multiple ML tools which solves
exacly the same problem , which one will output better solution and will
make us greater  revenue.
For that we  have  to define  some  function which  will be able  to output some
number which  represents how  well some ML tool solves  some bussines  question,  
so we will  be  able to choose  between multiple tools by comparing real numbers.
