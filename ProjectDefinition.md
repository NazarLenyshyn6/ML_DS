The main purpose of the current project is to learn machine learning and deep learning from the very beginning to the very end. But it is not just about learning core definitions and principles or why one tool works better than another. It is about building a deep understanding of how to leverage that knowledge in real-world business scenarios—how it can generate real revenue for a business.
All topics will be reinforced with code projects, and not a single project will be considered complete until it works perfectly and provides a scalable and useful platform for solving the corresponding problem. The main idea is to build the skill of creating production-ready ML/DL components that not only solve a specific task but provide real, workable, and useful tools and solutions—ones that work right now, will work then, and will keep working in the future.
A core principle is to build an ownership mentality and start taking responsibility for every single product. The goal is not just to write solutions but to write valuable solutions—ones that are truly authored and meaningful, fully documented, optimized, well-designed, and with clear definitions of why they are valuable, why they work and how they work.

Also that  project will act like greate detailed documentation and tutorial to review
all machine learning and deap learning  concepts  with hands on code examples and documentations, in case quick knowledge refresher is required.
